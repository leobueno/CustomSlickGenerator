# Slick Generator with workaround for 22 fields limit in case classes

__This project is a work in progress__ and still needs a lot of refactoring and testes. __Use at your own risk__!

## Usage:

1. Create a new object extending codegen.Config
1. Check the sample SamplePlaySlickGenerator to set db/user/password and to see how to use nested case classes
1. Check codegen.Config to understand other config options
